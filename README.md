The Odin Project
The game itself (the core) is finished, but because of school my worktime slows down and I cannot spend as much time on coding as before. That's why I won't finish it 100% like I want now.
Todos(for the future updates):
1. Restyling
2. Actual Smart AI
3. Code Refactor
4. React Version
